MiniChallenge#3 Who are you - GitHub Push
This is a program that will ask you what your name is and when you woke up and repeat it back to you.

Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Code is short, sweet, and easy to follow. Good work going the extra mile to make sure the user does not enter a number in the name field. When you get a chance change "WHat" to "What". I like that you validate that the time is a number. Play-again works well and plays again if user inputs anything but "no". You may want to account for mixed-case but othersie valid responses with a ToLower() at some point in case the user responds "No" or "NO" to make sure it quits out. Great work!
